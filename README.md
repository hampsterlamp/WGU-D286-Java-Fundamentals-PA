# WGU-D286-Java-Fundamentals-PA

## Why?
The PA / Lab 20 is the most important tool to passing this class, so I used it as a way to figure out different ways of doing the same things. I've uploaded it here to help those who might be a little stuck and just need a different way to look at the answers.

## How?
Different answers same results ex. Lab 1-1 and Lab 1-2 are written different but have the same output.

## Where?
Go to the correct Question folder and the code should be under the Lab x-y file

Some questions only have 1 answer or my alternate answers are just the same code but with more fluff and is confusing so I didnt add them.

## Can I help?

Sure the discussion is open, post a comment, ask a question, add your code if it's different from mine, this should also be on reddit.
